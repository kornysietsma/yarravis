To Investigate this, I walked upstream to have a look at the entrance of Gardiners Creek after our session and I notices some sort of barrier on Gardiners Creek, like a white bar submerged in the water, thahts all I could see from the opposite bank of Yarra River.  It looks like there is some construction going on anf workers have blocked the Gardiners Creek mouth to the Yarra River. It looks like this has reduced the flow of the Creek, so it may not be contributing much flow and just mixing with Yarra River upstrem water, eddying perhaps (swirling), this may be constricting the tide coming in, which could explain why the downstream salinity was so much higher.( At the time of sampling the tide did look it was coming in from the downstram site).",,Cloudy,Last 24 hrs,,,Slow,,,,No,,,,,,River,,Melbourne,Yarra River,Yarra River,Gardiners Creek,,145.025544435 N,-37.834234632 E,55,5810740,326250

? Flow measurement at site 2 (Scotchmans Creek) was done in a narrow part of the creek downstream of Valley Creek.  This was done to avoid problems with wind causing large errors at the usual site, which is the broad concrete outlet channel of the wetlands.

To Investigate this, I walked upstream to have a look at the entrance of Gardiners Creek after our session and I notices some sort of barrier on Gardiners Creek, like a white bar submerged in the water, thahts all I could see from the opposite bank of Yarra River.  It looks like there is some construction going on anf workers have blocked the Gardiners Creek mouth to the Yarra River. It looks like this has reduced the flow of the Creek, so it may not be contributing much flow and just mixing with Yarra River upstrem water, eddying perhaps (swirling), this may be constricting the tide coming in, which could explain why the downstream salinity was so much higher.( At the time of sampling the tide did look it was coming in from the downstram site).",,Cloudy,Last 24 hrs,,,Slow,,,,No,,,,,,River,,Melbourne,Yarra River,Yarra River,Gardiners Creek,,145.025544435 N,-37.834234632 E,55,5810740,326250

Just wanted to let you know that we did not obtain results for the ammonium and the conductivity tests. The range of the test sample was above what could be read by the conductivity meter (the instrument displayed ""OR"" when immersed in sample). The ammonium sample became cloudy after the chemicals were added and left to react for 15 mins. We repeated this test, however the second sample also became cloudy after 15 mins.
