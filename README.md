Note currently you need to run lesscss manually:
- install node and npm
- sudo npm install -g less
- sudo npm install -g autoless

to automatically build less on file changes:
$ autoless static/less/custom static/css

Eventually we should install a java or clojure less compiler - several are out there, though they all look a little flakey
